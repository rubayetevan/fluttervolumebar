## Getting Started

VolumeBar(
                  double.tryParse(_counter.toString()),
                10,

This project is a starting point for a Dart
[package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.
